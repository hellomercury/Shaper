# Shaper
Get in shape by shaping shapes.

# About
A time-killer game made with Unity engine. Try to keep as many items on the platform as you can. To make your life harder items have different shape and weight.

I wanted to make something simple yet playable and try myself in Unity and C#.
The game is cross-platform and currently available on Web and on Googple Play Store.
